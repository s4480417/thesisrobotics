# Project Title:
Medical robotics as a tool for measuring movement quality in neurorehabilitation.
# Project Description:
The project aims to assess the validity of clinical tests conducted by a pair of 6-DOF serial robots.
The clinical tests will be used to objectively and consistently measure the performance of a patients who have recently suffered from a stroke.
The robotic arms which are used for the first iteration are the Kinova Jaco2 (also called Gen2) arms, which are attached to the Kinova Movo robot.
The framework will be designed to be robust and be used with other arms (e.g. the Franka Emika Pandas).
